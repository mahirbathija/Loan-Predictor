# Loan-Predictor

This is the project I worked on during my stint at Protiviti Consulting. The main aim is to automate the loan approval process of the company Dream Home Financing by creating a prediction model using regression. I used data visualization techniques and logistic regression in Python in order to create my prediction model for loan approval. Libraries used - Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn and Sklearn just to name a few.
